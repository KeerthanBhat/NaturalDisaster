<h3>We propose a 4-fold relief operations system :</h3>
<div class="row">

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#3D3C3B;">
    <h2 style="color: #F9F7F4;">Distress Signal</h2>
    <p style="color: #F9F7F4;"><br />The victims stranded in any flood-affected area can send out distress signals through their phones. They need to record a distress SOS on their phone and dispatch it to the relief centre. Even though network connectivity will not be strong, a weak connection to nearby people's phone through bluetooth is sufficient. The SOS packet will be sent through an advanced routing algorithm.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#969089;">
    <h2>i-PAR algorithm for Ad-Hoc MANETs</h2>
    <p>The exisiting Ant Optimization Technique, Simple Ant Routing Algorithm send packets of data to neighbouring nodes until destination is reached and the destination node follows the same suite to find the optimal route. We have introduced novel improvements to this exisiting algorithm after a thorough research. A brief whitepaper about the algorithm and its design can be found <a href="http://bit.ly/BFS-iPAR">here.</a></p>
  </div>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#3D3C3B;">
    <h2 style="color: #F9F7F4;">SOS Analytics</h2>
    <p style="color: #F9F7F4;"><br /><br />The distress packet received from the network is analyzed at the relief centre. A huge number of calls will be incoming to the helpline numbers which will be exposed to some analytic techniques and the key parameters like resource needed, location of distress and urgency rate are determined so that appropriate help can be sent.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#969089;">
    <h2>Decentralized Donations</h2>
    <p>The general public will be able to donate resources to the flood victims through this decentralized system. They can send money through this payment portal which will be added into our blockchain. Through this blockchain, people can track the location of their money at any given time and make sure that it reaches the victims.</p>
